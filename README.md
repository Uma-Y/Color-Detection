# Color-Detection

In this color detection Python project, you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. We have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.

The colors.csv file includes 865 color names along with their RGB and hex values.

### How To Run

python color_detection.py -i <add your image path here>

Example: python color_detection.py -i pic1.jpg
